Create a game along the theme "Dredge"

You can make the game based on the actual game Dredge, or your own interpretation of the theme


The game must have the following:
1) Use of Navmesh
2) Use of Probuilder
3) Enemies or NPCs with state machines
4) Use of raycasts to detect things (can be player, enemies, pathfinding etc)
5) Use of animations/animator state machines
6) Use of triggers/collision detection to activate or detect physics or motion
7) Use of UI to denote score or other player-relevant information
8) High Concept document explaining an elevator pitch for the game (imagine a Steam description, with pictures etc) references to any assets used from external sources
9) 30 second to 1 minute trailer/gameplay video
