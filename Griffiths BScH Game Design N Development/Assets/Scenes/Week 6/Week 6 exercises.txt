Week 6 exercise

Make a game using at least 3 unity UI elements (e.g. buttons sliders toggle etc)
This can be any game e.g. a platformer, sizing something to fit into a hole, a bowling game where you use buttons to lock in the strength and sliders to adjust trajectory etc.

Examples of UI games from my other students:
